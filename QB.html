        <h3>QB</h3>
        <p align="center">The form of QB was a miniature replica of the famous Astor Place Cube known as the Alamo. The intervention was made of scrap wood, a cardboard box,
             wood glue, string, and a 30‚Äù wooden dowel, which supported the cube, allowing the user to push the cube in a circular motion similar to the lifesize model sitting next to it. The function of QB was to interact with the
            general populous of Astor place by drawing people in to converse with an inanimate object (through use of a Bluetooth speaker) in a meaningful way that would emulate emotions of empathy, affection, and care. </p>
